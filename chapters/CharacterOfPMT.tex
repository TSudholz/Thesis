Characterising the PMT at 600V and 900V
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the characteristics of the PMT at 900V as a baseline
\item Measure linearity
\item ND filters vs Two LED method
\item temperature effects
\end{itemize}

Measuring the PMT characteristics at both 900V and 600V. The aim is to use the measurements done at 900V as the baseline of expected performance and then observe the repeated measurements at 600V. We have a good  understanding of the characteristics of the PMT operating at 900V due to this being the nominal voltage that the PMTS in the FD telescopes are run at. I explore the characteristics at 600V as we are expecting to to reduce the PMT gain by a factor of 10 and this related to an approximate voltage drop to 600V. This may be an over estimate but we can be confident if the PMT voltage used is greater then 600V then the characteristics will be the same.

\section{PMT Linearity}

One of the main characteristics of a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) to measure is its linearity. A PMT linearity is where if a light intensity is doubled the PMT reponse doubles as while. It is important to quantify this region to be confident that if the light intensity changes the PMT response follows.

I look at two methods to measure the PMT linearity - using Neutral Density filters and the Two LED method.

\subsection{Neutral Density Filters}

The method of using Neutral Density filters involves employing filters to reduce the light intensity reaching the PMT cathode by a known amount. The filters were used singularly and in combination to get different Optical Transmission. The filters are label with optical density which is different to optical depth. To convert optical density to transmission:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Optical \ Depth} = - \mathrm{log}_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{Transmission}}{100} \right)
\end{equation}
To get different transmission values, the filters can be stack and the optical depth values just add together (IE. if using two filters one with ND 0.4 and ND 0.1 the total ND will be 0.5).

I repeated a study done by Privitera et. al. (1990) \textbf{ref.} on Auger PMTs. I wanted to use the result done at an High Voltage value of 900V as my baseline then continue the study to observe the result at an High Voltage value of 600V.

Some of the disadvantages of using Neutral Density filters it that you are restricted to fixed units of transmission depending on which filters you have access too. Also you are relying on the fact that the optical density doesn't change over time and is not effected by handing and storage. There is also some uncertainty on the optical density value quote.

\subsection{Two LED Method}

Another method investigate was the two LED method. This method was first used in the original measurement of the SD PMTs \textbf{ref}. To measure the linearity, two LEDs are pointed at the PMT and with one set of observations taken with the LEDs on separately then one set taken with the LEDs on at the same time. A graphical representation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TwoLEDmethod_Setup} of the set-up used to measure the PMT linearity at both 900V and 600V. Two pulse generators are used to drive the LEDs separately  

A ratio is plotted against peak pulse ampere. the ratio is calculated via:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Ratio} = \frac{\mathrm{LED}_{1+2}}{\mathrm{LED}_{1} + \mathrm{LED}_{2}}
\end{equation}
where LED$_{1+2}$ is the measurement when both LEDs are on at the same time, and LED$_{1}$ and LED$_2$ is the measurement when they are on separately. The principle employed here is that while the intensity is within the linearity region the peak of LED$_{1+2}$ should equal the addition of LED$_{1}$ and LED$_2$ separately.

The advantages of this method is that any LED levels can be used and do not have to worry about the two LEDs linearity. As long as the two LED intensities are different it will produce a different response in the PMT. 

The result of the two LED Method is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TwoLEDmethod_result} for both 900V and 600V. The x-axis is the peak ampere of the measured pulses when both LEDs are on at the same time.
