Measuring Gain Variance of FD PMT with CalA Data
\begin{itemize}
\item Measuring Gain Variance in the lab did not work. Equipment was not sensitive enough to the low current.
\item There was issues with calibrating the LED light source with another PMT (QE curve and wavelength response not the same?)
\item Using Low/Standard measurements of CalA to find Gain Variance Ratio
\item Three different methods
\item Bootstrap method to find uncertainties on Method 3
\end{itemize}
