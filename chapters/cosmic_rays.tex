\section{History of Cosmic-Rays}

First detection of ionizing radiation. 

1785: Coulomb found that 
electroscopes can spontaneously 
discharge by the action of the air 
and not by defective insulation

1835: Faraday confirms the 
observation by Coulomb, with 
better insulation technology

1879: Crookes measures that the 
speed of discharge of an 
electroscope decreased when 
pressure was reduced
