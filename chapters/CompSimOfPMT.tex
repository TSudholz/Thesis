\chapter{Computer Simulation of FD PMT}\label{Ch:CompSimPMT}

Simulating the FD PMT under differing NSB and for different reasons.
\begin{itemize}
\item Theoretical value for Gain Variance
\item PMT Gain Variance
\item Show both for flat distribution and Gaussian variations for dynodes
\item Results
\item FD FLT under increased NSB
\item Kv simulation under increased NSB?
\end{itemize}
