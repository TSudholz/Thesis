\chapter{Quantifying Characteristics of the FD PMT}\label{Ch:PMTCharacter}

Characterising the PMT at 600V and 900V
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the characteristics of the PMT at 900V as a baseline
\item Measure linearity
\item ND filters bs Two LED method
\item Pulse shape?
\item temperature effects
\item dark noise?
\end{itemize}
