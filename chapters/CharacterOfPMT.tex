%- Start off with moonlight explanation

%- Looking at effects of increased NSB on equipment

%- What type of PMT used

The Pierre Auger Observatory has been operational since 2004 and the Collaboration is in the process of rolling out upgrades to improve the experiment. The current upgrade has been name AugerPrime \textbf{(ref)} and is a large project to improve both the Surface Detectors (SD) and the Fluorescence Detectors (FD). The FD portion of AugerPrime involves extending the duty cycle to observe Extensive Air Shower (EAS) events while the moon is above the horizon. The main purpose for extending the FD duty cycle to include observation times while the moon is visible is to increase the statistics per year for EAS events at the highest energy ($>$ 10$^{19.5}$ eV). 

In this chapter I will explore the linearity and effects of temperature on the gain for a HAMAMATSU XP3062 Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) at the Hight Voltage setting of 600V. I will use the measurements obtained at 900V as the baseline of expected performance. The Fluorescence Detectors (FDs) at Auger use Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) as camera pixels within the telescopes to view the Extensive Air Showers. The PMTs are operated at a gain of 5 $\times$ 10$^4$ electrons per photo-electron. This gain relates to a High Voltage about 900V. The investigation into running the Fluorescence Detectors under moonlight has lead to the proposal of running the PMTs under decreased gain. The PMT gain is expected to decreased by a factor of 10 to compensate. Therefore the PMT High Voltage would be dropped to about 600V to have a gain of 5 $\times$ 10$^3$ electrons per photo-electron.

%The aim is to use the measurements done at 900V as the baseline of expected performance and then observe the repeated measurements at 600V. We have a good  understanding of the characteristics of the PMT operating at 900V due to this being the nominal voltage that the PMTS in the FD telescopes are run at. I explore the characteristics at 600V as we are expecting to to reduce the PMT gain by a factor of 10 and this related to an approximate voltage drop to 600V. This may be an over estimate but we can be confident if the PMT voltage used is greater then 600V then the characteristics will be the same.

\section{Background}

- HAMAMATSU XP3062 Photomultiplier Tube (PMT)
- 8 dynodes
- sensitive within the wavelength range
- is behind a UV filter
- Voltage across each dynode layout
- data sheet of expected behaviour

\section{PMT Linearity}

One of the major characteristics of interest when operating a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) is its linearity. A PMT linearity is where if a light intensity is doubled the PMT response doubles as while. It is important to quantify this region to be confident that if the light intensity changes the PMT response follows.

I look at two methods to measure the PMT linearity - using Neutral Density filters and the Two LED method.

\subsection{Neutral Density Filters}

The method of using Neutral Density filters involves employing filters to reduce the light intensity reaching the PMT cathode by a known amount. The filters were used singularly and in combination to get different Optical Transmission. The filters are label with optical density which is different to optical depth. To convert optical density to transmission:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Optical \ Depth} = - \mathrm{log}_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{Transmission}}{100} \right)
\end{equation}
To get different transmission values, the filters can be stack and the optical depth values just add together (IE. if using two filters one with ND 0.4 and ND 0.1 the total ND will be 0.5).

I repeated a study done by Privitera et. al. (1990) \textbf{ref.} on Auger PMTs. I wanted to use the result done at an High Voltage value of 900V as my baseline then continue the study to observe the result at an High Voltage value of 600V.

Some of the disadvantages of using Neutral Density filters it that you are restricted to fixed units of transmission depending on which filters you have access too. Also you are relying on the fact that the optical density do not deteriorate over time and is not effected by handing and storage. There is also some uncertainty on the optical density value quote.

\subsection{Two LED Method}

Another method investigate was the two LED method. This method was used in the original measurement of the SD PMTs \textbf{ref}. To measure the linearity, two LEDs are pointed at the PMT and with one set of observations taken with the LEDs on separately then one set taken with the LEDs on at the same time. A graphical representation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TwoLEDmethod_Setup} of the set-up used to measure the PMT linearity at both 900V and 600V. Two pulse generators are used to drive the LEDs separately and to allow the two pulses to overlap when needed to measure the PMT response to the LEDs on at the same time. To find the linearity a ratio is plotted against peak pulse ampere. the ratio is calculated via:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Ratio} = \frac{\mathrm{LED}_{1+2}}{\mathrm{LED}_{1} + \mathrm{LED}_{2}}
\end{equation}
where LED$_{1+2}$ is the measurement when both LEDs are on at the same time, and LED$_{1}$ and LED$_2$ is the measurement when they are on separately. The principle employed here is that while the intensity is within the linearity region the peak of LED$_{1+2}$ should equal the addition of LED$_{1}$ and LED$_2$ separately. Therefore the ratio should be one while both peak anode ampere from the LEDs on separately and LEDs on together are within the region of linearity. As the light intensity is increased the LEDs on together will first move out of the region of linearity first. Typically this means that the peak ampere measured from both LEDs on at the same time will be less then the combination of the peak ampere when measured separately. This will cause the ratio to dip below one.

The advantages of this method is that any LED levels can be used and do not have to worry about the two LEDs linearity. As long as the two LED intensities are different it will produce a different response in the PMT. 

The result of the two LED Method is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TwoLEDmethod_result} for both 900V and 600V. The x-axis is the peak ampere of the measured pulses when both LEDs are on at the same time. The plots show that while the peak anode currents change by a close factor of 10, the gain of the PMT has also been reduced by a similar factor. This seems to indicate that the cathode is the limiting factor for the PMT linearity for this type. \textbf{Maybe quote theoretical peak anode current for a 10$^{21}$ eV shower}.

\section{Effects of Temperature on PMT Gain}

Quoted on any PMT data sheet is the expected change in gain as a function of energy. The XP3062 PMT used in the FD telescopes is quoted to be -0.2\%$\backslash$K. I measured this value in the lab at University of Adelaide at both 900V and 600V. The set-up to monitor the gain of the PMT involved a LED inside a copper oven pointed at the cathode pulsed once per second, and a temperature gauge. I was able to control the laboratory temperature to see the gain change over a variety of temperature values. The LED was inside a copper oven to maintain an independent constant temperature so the number of photons emitted could considered to be fixed. The PMT was inside a box that highly light proof - the top was held down with screws, then two layers of black electrical tape was applied to the lid joinings and then a black out curtain was draped over the top. Only the temperature was allowed to vary over the measurement period. Therefore any changes in the absolute ADC measurements are related to changes in the PMT gain.

Measurements for temperature vs PMT gain was taken at both High Voltage values of 900V and 600V.The plots in Fig. \ref{fig:PMTtemp_v_gain} the effects of temperature on the PMT can be clearly seen at both high voltage values. For either high voltage value the measured PMT gain changer per K was -0.6\%$\backslash$K \textbf{needs uncertainty}. This maybe different to the quoted data sheet but is not unreasonable. The quoted data sheet is an average of many PMTs while this is a measurement of one particular PMT. What was interested was that this value did not deviate if using the PMT at 900V or 600V.
